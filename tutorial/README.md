of [Watson Studio Pipelines](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/ml-orchestration-overview.html).

Over its course, you will learn how to:
* create a simple pipeline, based on a sample from gallery
* add and remove pipeline parameters
* modify node parameters
* use Python notebooks inside a WS pipeline

The subsequent parts of the course are split into separate files:
* [Prerequisites](./prerequisites.md)
* [Sample 1](./sample01.md)
